# Team44_RTF-TechFest-23-
Our first school hackathon project.

Problem Statement:
HDB manages over 2000 carparks, with more than 660k car parks and 7000 equipment that supports the operations of the carpark. Our car parks are visited by 500k unique motorists and the system processes 2.5m transactions daily. It is not possible for HDB to deploy staff/maintenance teams to be at every car park, due to the sheer number of car parks and equipment. Also, the situation is exacerbated by the manpower crunch brought about by our aging population. Hence, we are looking for a solution that allows HDB to rely on the residents to take ownership of their estateâ€™s well-being, and partner HDB to improve the estate.

Objective: To leverage on technology (mobile app, crowdsourcing, etc) to create a fun and engaging solution that allows residents to check on HDB car parks, monitor the maintenance/rectification progress if any and take ownership for the well-being of their estate

**Inspiration**
We found inspiration in various websites and applications such as oneservice.gov.sg which also has a similar reporting issues feature. Parking@HDB, Hdb.gov.sg, and SGSecure are other platforms we were inspired by while working on the features and layout of our webpage.

**What it does**
Our crowdsourcing community website gathers collective, on-site feedback directly from residents which reach HDB, allowing them to take immediate action and ensure proper maintenance as well as update residents about ongoing works in the car parks.

**How we built it**
We created our webpage using HTML and CSS. Javascript functions were linked nicely within the HTML sheet to provide a smooth, dynamic web experience. We split the workload by taking subpages to work and merging all of them later to ensure flow. We referred to secondary sources like Youtube tutorials and coding websites to gain inspiration to get started with the code for different features in the website. We researched to get to know about the context of the problem statement and drew out designs before we started to code. We then pieced together everything, with aesthetics and practicality in mind, ensuring the website is user-friendly and accessible.
